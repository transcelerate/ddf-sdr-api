# Sample Protocols

Study protocols are available as USDM 4.0 conformant JSON files.  Some of the sample protocols also include the original PDF.  All sample protocols are publicly available.  
The USDM conformant representations are not guaranteed to be "complete" representations of the original PDF, but are meant to demonstrate how the protocol is mapped. The sample protocols are continuously updated and refined and will be maintained here.

Available as JSON and PDF:
- CDISC Pilot Study (LZZT)
- An Eli Lilly Diabetes Study (NCT03421379)
- An Alexion Wilson's Disease Study (NCT04573309)
- A Bayer Stroke Study protocol (NCT04304508)
- A Roche Phase 2a study for Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (NCT02701985)

In addition, two temporary examples have been included. The data contained within these examples is test data and does not map directly to an existing protocol.

- Devices: This file shows the handling of medical devices. 
- Observational: This file shows a simple example of an observational study and the attributes for the StudyDesign class
